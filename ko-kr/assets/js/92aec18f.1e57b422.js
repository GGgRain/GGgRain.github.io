It\'s because we focused on the development of new features instead of refactoring the code due to the limited time on the development.\\n\\n**So we decided to work on SDS2.**\\n\\n### How will the SDS2 be look like?\\n\\nWe are aiming to make SDS2 as a StoryGraph system.\\n\\nYou will be able to make any dialogue, or cutscene productions with the SDS2, beyond just a mere text-based dialogue.\\n\\nSDS2 will completely support multiplayer games and replicated dialogues.\\n\\nSDS2 will be reinforced with a ton of better editing features. Every stuff and Every property can be accessible and duplicate-able in the graph side so you don\'t need to mess around the detail panel.\\n\\nSDS2 will have its own text animation system that is powered by our new slate animation module, **Volt**. Volt library will also be included in the SDS2 to provide much more convincing editor visual and runtime animations.\\n\\nWe can not the all the stuff by right now, but there will be a lot of changes on the system, and it will be something that you\'ve never seen before from elsewhere.\\n\\n### Should I buy SDS2 again?\\n\\nNo, Since the SDS1 will be updated to the SDS2, the users of the SDS1 don\'t need to buy SDS again.\\n\\n### When will it be released?\\n\\nThere is nothing I can be sure about it, but it will take at least 3~5 months to finish.\\n\\n## Future of SDS1\\n\\nBy the 1.16.4 update, we already implemented everything we had in mind for the SDS.\\n\\nWe will keep active in providing patch versions for the LTS version (1.16.x) for SDS1.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe will actively share the news of SDS2 here.
